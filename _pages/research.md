## Education Expansion, Sorting, and the Decreasing Wage Premium ##

This paper studies the interplay between education expansion and workers and firms sorting in Portugal between 1987 and 2017. The Portuguese labor market is characterized by three facts: a decreasing high school wage premium, a dramatic increase in supply of high school graduates, and an increasingly unbalanced distribution of high school graduates across industries. To quantify the impact of the latter two on the former, I build a model of one-to-many matching where workers sort with firms based on their own preferences, their relative productivity within the firm, and substitution patterns with other workers. Using tool from the optimal transport literature, I solve the model and structurally estimate it on matched employer-employee data. Estimates suggest changes in sorting are mainly driven by heterogeneous increase in relative productivity of high school graduates relative to non graduates across industries. It acts as a mitigating force on the decreasing high school wage premium, but does not fully compensate for high school graduates' rise in relative supply.     

The data was kindly provided by the Instituto Nacional de Estatistica with the help of Francesco Franco at Nova SBE in Lisbon.


## Repeated Matching Games: an Empirical Framework ##

With Jeremy Fox and Alfred Galichon.

We introduce a model of dynamic matching with transferable utility. Agents have individual
states that evolve with current matches. Each period, a matching market with market-clearing
prices takes place. We discuss a full equilibrium with time-varying distributions of agent types and
show that a stationary equilibrium exists. We propose two algorithms to compute a stationary
equilibrium and show how to modify the algorithms for estimation. We estimate a model of
geographic mobility by Swedish engineers.

## Decreasing Returns to Experience for higher education graduates in France: an Occupational Analysis ##

This project in conducted as part of a [CEREQ workgroup](https://www.cereq.fr/le-cereq-activites-scientifiques-groupes-de-travail-et-seminaires/groupe-dexploitation-generation) (in French).

[Draft](https://paulinecorblet.github.io/pdf/CEREQUnequalReturntoExp.pdf)

Thanks to detailed survey data provided by CEREQ (Enquêtes Générations) that covers young French workers' early career, I highlight a slow down in university educated workers' wage growth. This slow down can be broken down in two separate margins over the space of occupations: an extensive margin, by which the share of workers in occupations that feature a steep wage increase has fallen down, and an intensive margin, by which wage progression within occupations has flattened out for younger cohorts. I am able to quantitatively estimate these two margins and establish the intensive margin is the main driver of wage growth slowing down. Finally, I explore two mechanisms, access to management level posts and skill mismatch, and am able to show they contribute to a decrease in wage growth within occupations.
