## Cohort Wage Inequality at Firm Level ##

Using Portuguese matched employer employee data, I investigate the decrease in return to experience for university educated workers between 1986 and 2017. I rely on a simple supply and demand framework in the spirit of Card and Lemieux (2001) and relax the labor supply exogeneity assumption by building a static one-to-many matching model with worker complementarity in the production function. Unobserved heterogeneity enters additively in production. Match production is just identified by observed matching.   

The data was kindly provided by the Instituto Nacional de Estatistica with the help of Francesco Franco at Nova SBE in Lisbon.

## A Dynamic Model of Two-sided Matching ##

With Jeremy Fox and Alfred Galichon.

In this paper we present a model of dynamic two-sided matching where the types of agents are subject to Markov transitions which are affected by the agent's current match. Our model is therefore a two-sided analog of Rust's model of dynamic discrete choice. We work out the equilibrium equation in thefinite and infinite horizon cases and we investigate stationarity.
