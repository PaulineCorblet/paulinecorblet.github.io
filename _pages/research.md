## Cohort Wage Inequality at Firm Level ##

Using Portuguese matched employer employee data, I investigate the decrease in return to experience for university educated workers between 1986 and 2017. I rely on a simple supply and demand framework in the spirit of Card and Lemieux (2001) and relax the labor supply exogeneity assumption by building a static one-to-many matching model with worker complementarity in the production function. Unobserved heterogeneity enters additively in production. Match production is just identified by observed matching.   

The data was kindly provided by the Instituto Nacional de Estatistica with the help of Francesco Franco at Nova SBE in Lisbon.

## A Dynamic Model of Two-sided Matching ##

With Jeremy Fox and Alfred Galichon.

In this paper we present a model of dynamic two-sided matching where the types of agents are subject to Markov transitions which are affected by the agent's current match. Our model is therefore a two-sided analog of Rust's model of dynamic discrete choice. We work out the equilibrium equation in thefinite and infinite horizon cases and we investigate stationarity.

## Decreasing Returns to Experience in France: an Occupational Analysis ##

This project in conducted as part of a [CEREQ workgroup](https://www.cereq.fr/le-cereq-activites-scientifiques-groupes-de-travail-et-seminaires/groupe-dexploitation-generation) (in French).

Thanks to detailed survey data provided by CEREQ (Enquêtes Générations) that covers young French workers' early career, I highlight a slow down in university educated workers' wage growth. This slow down can be broken down in two separate margins over the space of occupations: an extensive margin, by which the share of workers in occupations that feature a steep wage increase has fallen down, and an intensive margin, by which wage progression within occupations has flattened out for younger cohorts. I am able to quantitatively estimate these two margins and establish the intensive margin is the main driver of wage growth slowing down. Finally, I explore two mechanisms, access to management level posts and skill mismatch, and am able to show they contribute to a decrease in wage growth within occupations.
