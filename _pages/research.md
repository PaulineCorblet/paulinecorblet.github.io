## Education Expansion, Technological Change, and the Decreasing Wage Premium ##

The wage gap between educated and uneducated workers has grown quickly in the 1970s and the 1980s in the US, despite the uninterrupted rise in the relative supply of educated workers. Since the 2000s however, the education wage premium has stagnated in many western economies. I examine the heterogeneity of the graduate wage premium evolution to age, as its decrease is particularly sharp for young workers. I investigate three channels to explain this decrease: the rise of the educated workers relative supply, changes in demand brought by technological change, and sorting between workers and firms. To do so, I build a model of one-to-many matching, which uses the most recent advances in matching theory and computational matching to make predictions both on wages and matching. The model affords flexibility in identification that lets me estimate sorting between workers and firms as well as varying elasticities of substitution over time. I estimate the model on Portuguese administrative data and I find evidence of skill-biased technological change that has increased the demand for educated workers. However the magnitude of technological change varies by industry, and I find that young educated workers favor industries where technological change is most modest.

The data was kindly provided by the Instituto Nacional de Estatistica with the help of Francesco Franco at Nova SBE in Lisbon.


## Repeated Matching Games: an Empirical Framework ##

With Jeremy Fox and Alfred Galichon.

We introduce a model of dynamic matching with transferable utility. Agents have individual
states that evolve with current matches. Each period, a matching market with market-clearing
prices takes place. We discuss a full equilibrium with time-varying distributions of agent types and
show that a stationary equilibrium exists. We propose two algorithms to compute a stationary
equilibrium and show how to modify the algorithms for estimation. We estimate a model of
geographic mobility by Swedish engineers.

## Decreasing Returns to Experience in France: an Occupational Analysis ##

This project in conducted as part of a [CEREQ workgroup](https://www.cereq.fr/le-cereq-activites-scientifiques-groupes-de-travail-et-seminaires/groupe-dexploitation-generation) (in French).

Thanks to detailed survey data provided by CEREQ (Enquêtes Générations) that covers young French workers' early career, I highlight a slow down in university educated workers' wage growth. This slow down can be broken down in two separate margins over the space of occupations: an extensive margin, by which the share of workers in occupations that feature a steep wage increase has fallen down, and an intensive margin, by which wage progression within occupations has flattened out for younger cohorts. I am able to quantitatively estimate these two margins and establish the intensive margin is the main driver of wage growth slowing down. Finally, I explore two mechanisms, access to management level posts and skill mismatch, and am able to show they contribute to a decrease in wage growth within occupations.
