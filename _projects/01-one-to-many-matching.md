Using Portuguese matched employer employee data, I investigate the decrease in return to experience for university educated workers between 1986 and 2017. I rely on a simple supply and demand framework in the spirit of Card and Lemieux (2001) and relax the labor supply exogeneity assumption by building a static one-to-many matching model with worker complementarity in the production function. Unobserved heterogeneity enters additively in production. Match production is just identified by observed matching.\   

The data was kindly provided by the Instituto Nacional de Estatistica with the help of Francesco Franco at Nova SBE in Lisbon.
