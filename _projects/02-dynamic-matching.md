With Jeremy Fox and Alfred Galichon.

We introduce a model of dynamic matching with transferable utility. Agents have individual
states that evolve with current matches. Each period, a matching market with market-clearing
prices takes place. We discuss a full equilibrium with time-varying distributions of agent types and
show that a stationary equilibrium exists. We propose two algorithms to compute a stationary
equilibrium and show how to modify the algorithms for estimation. We estimate a model of
geographic mobility by Swedish engineers.
