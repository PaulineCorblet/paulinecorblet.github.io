With Jeremy Fox and Alfred Galichon.\

In this paper we present a model of dynamic two-sided matching where the types of agents are subject to Markov transitions which are affected by the agent's current match. Our model is therefore a two-sided analog of Rust's model of dynamic discrete choice. We work out the equilibrium equation in thefinite and infinite horizon cases and we investigate stationarity.
